# flaskdemo
Demo Flask Site for CSCI

## How do I run it?
Well you'll have to pip install flask and stuff. We'll go over that later if you need.

## What's the deal?
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jao3XiiXOPE] Gives a quick rundown of how the site is constructed.

The source, though, is more important. 

Basically, I wanted to show how quickly a site using our "stack" (minus databases) can be cooked up.
It uses Flask-Sessions for logging in, we'd have to change some stuff for security reasons but 
generally speaking it's all there what we would need to do. 

## Just check out the source
All the python required resides in app.py. All the html/jinja resides in the templates folder.
It's pretty simple, and depending on the specs of our site we could use this as a template even!
